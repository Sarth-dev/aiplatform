## Research

I reviewed the following 5 AI platform UIs:
1. OpenAI Playground: Clean tabular UI, easy model switching, comprehensive settings for completion parameters.
2. Hugging Face Spaces: Modular, open design with public demos and flexible layout, good template handling.
3. Anthropic Claude UI: Minimal and accessible, quick prompt/response workflow, live result updates.
4. Microsoft Copilot Lab: Task-focused, guided prompt builder, prominent 'run' actions and sample templates.
5. Mistral Chat: Direct chat-based interface, concise controls, excellent mobile responsiveness.

Chosen Features:
- Model selector (inspired by Playground & Claude)
- Prompt editor with templates (from Copilot Lab & Hugging Face)
- Parameter panel (temperature, max tokens) (Playground)
- Theme toggle (all platforms favoring accessibility)
- Chat/output area with copy/download functionality (Claude & Spaces)

## Design

Figma/XD Mockup:  
[Mockup Screenshot/Link here]  
(Attach your exported Figma/XD wireframe, or paste a screenshot.)

- Spacing, Typography, Colors:  
  Used Tailwind’s spacing tokens for padding/margin (`p-6`, `space-y-6`).  
  Typography leverages Tailwind’s font classes (`text-2xl`, `font-bold`), ensuring visual hierarchy and readability.  
  Primary colors use Tailwind’s blue shades for focus/actions, gray/white backgrounds for clarity, and accessibility.

- Accessibility & UX: 
  Each interactive element is labeled and keyboard accessible. Focus rings are visible via Tailwind’s `focus:ring-2`, with smooth hover/transition states.

- Design↔Code Translation:
  The Figma mockup organized controls vertically with space and clear grouping. Coded UI mirrors this arrangement for consistency. Dark mode toggle and invalid state feedback reflect design intent.

## Development

Key Features:
- Model Selector: Dropdown to pick GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral, Custom.
- Prompt Editor: Textarea with templates (dummy JSON), instant insertion.
- Parameters Panel: Sliders for temperature and max tokens, with real-time value display.
- Chat/Output Area: Displays prompt/responses; includes Copy & Download chat as JSON for each message.
- Theme Toggle: Light/dark mode persisted in localStorage.
- Responsive Layout: Mobile up to desktop breakpoints using Tailwind classes.
- Data & State:Simulates API for models/templates; handles loading/error states.

Accessibility & UX Polish:
- All controls have ARIA labels and are accessible by keyboard.
- Focus rings and hover animations are provided for all actionable items.

Component Library & Storybook:
- Storybook is set up (see `/storybook`) with stories for Button, Slider, Modal, ChatBubble.
